FxCop for redundant classes and variables
For development:
I have some reservations about migrating to .NET core 2.0 & standard 2.0 was that the new cproj file format (that automatically includes every .cs file) that was there was some unused classes in the solution.

Therefore I'm using FxCop for to remove redundant classes (and variables)

Steps:

1) nuget Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers into all Mg projects
i.e. Install-Package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers

2) Copy Tools/RuleSet1.ruleset into the project folder and then rename file to match assembly name with FxCop suffix i.e. Magnesium.FxCop.ruleset


2a) For .net core & .net standard projects 
e.g Magnesium, Magnesium.Toolkit, Magnesium.Vulkan

Copy into .csproj file:

<PropertyGroup Condition=" '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Debug|AnyCPU' ">
  ...
  <CodeAnalysisRuleSet>RuleSet1.ruleset</CodeAnalysisRuleSet>
</PropertyGroup>

2b) For .NET framework
